# Calendar Application

Basically three operations can be done in this calendar application. To find out the day corresponding to a given date, the date, month and year are asked. You can list the days and dates of any month of any year. For example, entering 04 2014 (April 2014) will give you an output as shown in the screenshot in this post.

You can navigate the months using arrow keys, or press ‘n’ and ‘p’ keys to view the next and previous months respectively. The third feature of this C mini project on Calendar application utilizes file handling. With this feature, you can add important notes with corresponding dates.

The functions used in the source code are simple and easy to understand. The ones listed below have been used to produce background with color effects. They are described in the source code with comments.

* void SetColor(int ForgC)
* void ClearConsoleToColors(int ForgC, int BackC)
* void SetColorAndBackground(int ForgC, int BackC)

void gotoxy (int x, int y) – You need to understand this function as it is an important one used in this Calendar in C language. You can find this function used in many C projects. This function allows you to print text in any place of screen.
